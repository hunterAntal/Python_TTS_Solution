faculty member, perhaps we can model this with two separate optional
relationships from Moderator to Student and Faculty. So, each Moderator
must be linked to either a Student or a Faculty but not both. That way,
when creating a Club-Moderator relationship, it's mandatory that the
Moderator exists and is linked to either a student or faculty.

But I'm getting confused here. Maybe an alternative approach: Instead of
having a Moderator entity, just have attributes in Club indicating whether
the moderator is a student or faculty. But that might not capture all
necessary details because each Moderator can moderate multiple Clubs? Or
wait, does each Club have one Moderator, but a Moderator can moderate only
one Club?

Wait, actually, the problem states "Each club has one moderator," but it
doesn't specify if a moderator can moderate multiple clubs. So perhaps
moderators can moderate multiple clubs or just one. The problem isn't
clear on that. But in any case, for now, let's assume that a Moderator
(whether student or faculty) can moderate multiple Clubs.

Therefore, the Club-Moderator relationship is many-to-many. Wait, no: Each
Club has exactly one Moderator. So it's one-to-one from Club to Moderator?
Or maybe one-to-many if a Moderator can have multiple Clubs?

Wait, no, each Club has one Moderator, but a Moderator can be associated
with multiple Clubs. So it's a one-to-many relationship from Moderator to
Clubs.
